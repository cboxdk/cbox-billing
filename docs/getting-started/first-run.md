# First run & seed data

A fresh database is empty. Seed it with a realistic demo catalog so every console
screen and API endpoint has real rows to project from.

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

`migrate:fresh` drops and re-creates every table; `--seed` runs `DatabaseSeeder`,
which creates a test user and then calls three seeders.

## What the seeders create

### `CatalogSeeder` — the demo product and plans

One product (**Cbox Billing**) with a four-plan monthly ladder. Each plan is priced
in **DKK + EUR + USD** (integer minor units), carries a recurring **included-credit
grant**, and declares **per-meter entitlements**.

Four metered dimensions are seeded: `api.requests`, `seats`, `storage.gb`,
`events.ingested`.

| Plan | EUR / mo | Included credits | api.requests | seats | storage.gb | events.ingested |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Starter** | €39.00 | 50,000 | 100k (bill overage) | 3 (block) | 10 GB (block) | disabled |
| **Team** | €169.00 | 250,000 | 1M (bill) | 10 (bill) | 100 GB (block) | 500k (bill) |
| **Business** | €469.00 | 1,000,000 | 5M (bill) | 50 (bill) | 1,000 GB (block) | 5M (bill) |
| **Scale** | €1,329.00 | 5,000,000 | unlimited | unlimited | 10,000 GB (block) | unlimited |

Each entitlement is a projection-ready meter policy: `enabled`, `allowance`, a
per-unit `multiplier` (overage weight), `unlimited`, and an `overage` behaviour
(`Bill` or `Block`). See [Catalog & pricing](../concepts/catalog-and-pricing.md).

The seeder also gives one plan per **tiered pricing model** a real tier schedule so
the catalog console renders tier tables:

- **Team** → `graduated` (each seat slice billed at its own tier's rate).
- **Business** → `volume` (every seat billed at the single tier the total lands in).
- **Scale** → `package` (a block price per pack of 10 seats).
- **Starter** → `stairstep` (one flat price for the whole seat bracket).

The base `price_minor` stays the list recurring amount the MRR read model sums; the
tier set is the per-seat schedule that price scales by.

### `LicensingSeeder` — on-prem licensing profiles

Seeds the licensable-plan data behind the on-prem licensing profiles (see
`config/billing.php` → `licensing.profiles`: `enterprise-onprem`, `team-onprem`)
so the [Licenses console](console-tour.md) and the
[license issue flow](../cookbook/issue-a-license.md) have plans to mint from.

### `OrganizationSeeder` — a first billing organization

Seeds a billing organization so the console customer list and the API have an org
to act on. One billing account maps to one identity organization (see
[org-level entitlements](../identity/entitlements.md)).

## Signing in

With **no** `CBOX_ID_ISSUER` set (the local default), the login screen shows a
**demo sign-in** button. It creates a local operator session — no live identity
provider needed — and lands on the dashboard. The provider console is a single
operator surface, so any authenticated session administers it.

Once you configure a real Cbox ID instance, demo sign-in disappears and the OIDC
authorization-code + PKCE flow takes over. See [OIDC login](../identity/oidc-login.md).

## Re-seeding

The seeders use `updateOrCreate`, so re-running `db:seed` is idempotent — it
refreshes the demo rows without duplicating them. Use `migrate:fresh --seed` when
you want a clean slate.
